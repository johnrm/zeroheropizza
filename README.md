## Testing 

### Responsiveness
All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers.

Steps to test:
1. Open browser and navigate to [Zúm Pizza](https://johnrm.github.io/zumpizza/)
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width

Expected:
Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.

Actual:
All behaviour is as expected

Website was also opened on the following devices and no responsive issues were seen:
- Google Pixel 4
- Samsung Galaxy A52
- Samsung Galaxy Tablet

### Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

Manual tests were also performed to ensure the website was as accessible as possible.

### Lighthouse Testing
Accessibility score was 100% for accessibility for every page in Lighthouse tools in Chrome Developertools.<br>

## Bugs
This was a first project so there were number of bugs in the code.<br>
There were layout issues throughout which were remedied from research online and some trial and error.<br>
This resulted from lack of understanding of Flexbox but this is a lot clearer now.<br>
Flexbox Issues were principally on index.html but have been remedied.<br>
<br>
Foreground text on menu.html was barely visible regardless of font changes.<br>
Updating CSS for '.borderpizza' with 'background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .4);' and 'background-blend-mode: multiply;' resolved this.<br>
<br>
Not a bug per se, but there was a Validation issue with iframe which is detailed in Validation section ([here](#validate-html-and-css))<br>
<br>
Again, not a bug but validation of the thanks page was failing as I had width=100% and height=auto on the video element.<br>
Removing these and placing in CSS corrected this.<br>

## Validate html and CSS
HTML validation was successful with official W3C validator with 1 exception.<br>
<br>
Index.html validation fails on iframe width percentage. However, the code works without issue.

```
                <iframe
                src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1vGMCsnZHs91CGv4S2h5phSu21rrh6fM&hl=en&ehbc=2E312F"
                width="100%" height="250"></iframe>
```

CSS validation passes the official(Jigsaw) validator but with a warning on Google Fonts...
